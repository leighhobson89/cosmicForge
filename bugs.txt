when power on with a basic power plant, carbon production severely reduced in reality but appears to only be reduced by 2/s
if you buy a resource or compound in the GM befoe it is revealed, could be a better way of handling it than just allowing it and then it showing up when it is revealed

REALLY TO DO TO END OF GAME
    - ADD REST OF STATISTICS
    - ADD ACHIEVEMENTS TO INCLUDE PHILOSOPHIES AND MEGASTRUCTURE STORY ARC
    - TELL A STORY IN THE INTRO POPUPS AND ADD MORE OF THIS THROUGHOUT ALL THE GAME
