when power on with a basic power plant, carbon production severely reduced in reality but appears to only be reduced by 2/s
if you buy a resource or compound in the GM befoe it is revealed, could be a better way of handling it than just allowing it and then it showing up when it is revealed
think about tooltip for hovering resource generation to cover scenarios like using fuel for power plants
add mechanics for blackhole either in game and in the black hole ui we created and integrate time warp function in to it, and check if battery charge needs timewarp integration
